Inject the `ngWindowManager` module as your app dependency
```

```
Use the element
```
	  <wmwindow title="Good title" options="{{options}}" > My window content {{something_from_scope}} </wmwindow>
``` 
You can also have multiple windows under an element from an array
```
	  <wmwindow title="{{article.title}}" ng-repeat="article in articles"  > <p>{{article.body}} <p></wmwindow>
``` 
### Parameters
* _title_: Window title
* _open_: Function executed when window is opened.
* _close_: Function executed when window is closed.
* _maximize_: Function executed when window is maximized.
* _restore_: Function executed when a window is restored.
* _options_: Additional options to customize the window, see below. 
* _maximizable_: Boolean to determine if window can be maximized. (it must be set from $scope variable)
* _closeable_: Boolean to determine if window can be closed. (it must be set from $scope variable)

### Options 
You can pass some options to a window to customize the behaviour:
 * _position_ {x, y} : Initial position of the window when it's created  
 * _size_ {width, height}: Initial size of the window when it's created
 * _maximizeTo_: Element id where the windows will be maximized (when user push the button) 
 * _windowContainer_: Element id where windows can move over. If not provided parent element would be the windowContainer.
 * _initialZIndex_: You can specify if your window starts on a specified z index

Options example:

```
$scope.options = {
		position: {x: 120, y:320},
		size: {width: 300, height:300},
		maximizeTo: 'contentArea',
		windowContainer: 'myMoveZone'
	};
```
## Executing actions

When you define an action from list above to be executed, you must receive with a parameter windowHandler. 
``` 
	 <wmwindow title="Good title" open="onopen" ...>
```

```
$scope.onopen = function (win){
	
	//When the window is open then move to position 100 100
	win.windowHandler.move (100,100);
	...
};
```
As you see you can use the `windowHandler` object of the window to execute the actions and access to the window's elements.
